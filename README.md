# AdventureGame
The application was created as a clone of an old game called Adventure Game.

I modeled it on the mechanics of the old game, but during writing this application I just wanted to practice using Java collections, and I/O operations.

The game contains a file with test data, which was used to understand the game mechanism and write code, and with data from the Internet, so that the game is much more developed and resembles its original.

Feel free to play :)
