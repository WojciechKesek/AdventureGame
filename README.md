# AdventureGame
The application was created as a clone of an old game called Adventure Game.

While it draws inspiration from the original game's mechanics, my primary goal during its development was to sharpen my skills in utilizing Java collections and performing I/O operations

The game contains a a dataset from a local file, which was used to understand the game mechanism and write code.
Additionally, I integrated data from the internet to enhance the game and bring it closer to its original form.

Feel free to play :)
